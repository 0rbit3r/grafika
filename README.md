# Grafika

> A beautiful graph rendering engine

The main purpose of this library is to encapsulate graph-rendering logic for [Aphantasia](https://github.com/0rbit3r/aphantasia), but it might be useful for a variety of graph vizualization purposes.

**NOTICE:** This project is still in development - usage, contributions and documentation details will be added eventually.
